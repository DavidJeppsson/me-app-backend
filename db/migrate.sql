"My name is David Jeppsson, I was raised in the city of Malm√∂.
I live together with my girlfirend Ingrid and our dog Bilbo.
We might soon move to Stockholm but that is another story.

I enjoy playing different kinds of board games together with my firends.
I also enjoy being outdoors in nature. A hobby that i share with my dog.

During my youth I played a plethera of sports, including American Fotball and Ice Hockey.
I still play hockey, in a beer league.
Which is basically an amature league and we don't drink beer while playing... yet.

Ave!"
